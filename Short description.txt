1. "Products", "Categories", "Companies", "Operators, "Sites, "Roles" have to be determined at the begining. In the future Backend will allow to add fields/records in a specific way if needed.

2. Next step before test is proper configuration. In CoreSync tester's software operator will tick his name and choose adequate test. It will lead to automated choice of a "Products" and also "Operators" records.

3. Operator scans label (on PCBA) from supplier which allows program to put external SN to database under 'SN2' in "Entities". First of all CoreSync tester (Software) checks product by 'SN' - if exists in "Entities", it will take information out of it and put to "Tests". If does not exist, record is created in "Entities" and then put to "Tests". 'ReleaseDate' is filled with a date of manufacture if CoreSync product is not a RMA product, otherwise 'ReleaseDate' gets null value.

4. CoreSync tests are divided into 3 groups of subtests based on a correlation with each other: 
- 'Cat1_2' - GW 90W, GW 60W CV, ELB Single&Dual Channel, Driver Single&Dual Channel, Driver CV
- 'Cat3' - Adv. Env. Sensor, Adv. Light. Sensor, Beacon Sensor
- 'Cat4' - IM
It allows to optimize number of necessary tests to be taken and written into database. "Categories" record assigned to "Tests" from point 2. defines adequate subtest.

5. Fields in "Cat1_2", "Cat3" and "Cat4" are filled with values from actual test. Then CoreSync tester (Software) compare them to reference values. If they are in proper range, 'TestResult' in "Tests" is pass, otherwise fail.

!Annotation!
Quote "" means table in database.
Apostrophe '' means column in database.
Field is one particular element of a record.
Record is a full set of fields.

=========
|Backend|
=========
 
In "Entities", 'SN' and 'MAC' are nullable, but CoreSync tester's software will force to put value in at least one field to ensure we have our unique ID of every product.
'SN2' is also nullable, but without any restrictions.
